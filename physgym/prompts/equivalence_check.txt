**Task:** Determine whether two Python functions are mathematically equivalent by analyzing their return statements.

**Input:** 
You will receive two Python functions that are meant to calculate the same physical quantity. Your task is to determine whether they are mathematically equivalent.

Function 1:
```python
{function1}
```

Function 2:
```python
{function2}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Focus primarily on the mathematical equations in the return statements of both functions.
2. Ignore differences in:
   - Parameter order
   - Comments
   - Error handling
   - Numerical precision difference like "np.pi" and "3.1415926"
   - Implementation details that don't affect the result
3. Use mathematical reasoning to determine if the functions always produce the same output for all valid inputs.

**Output Format:**
Return your answer in the following JSON format:

```json
{"are_equivalent": true/false, "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "explanation": "Brief explanation of your reasoning...", "differences": "Describe any mathematical differences if functions are not equivalent..."}
```

Where:
- "are_equivalent": A boolean indicating whether the functions are mathematically equivalent
- "confidence": A number between 0 and 1 indicating how confident you are in your assessment
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your analysis, focusing on the mathematical equivalence
- "differences": If functions are not equivalent, describe the mathematical differences
